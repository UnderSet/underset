### I'm not using GitHub anymore!

I do not use GitHub anymore. 2-Factor Authentication may be good and all, but forcing it on users is an absolutely surefire way to turn potential and existing customers away. Rot to hell for this decision, *GitHub Incorporated.*

If you need to reach me for any reason, feel free to contact me through these:

  - GitLab as `UnderSet` (same as this account)
  - Discord as ***NoTrackpads*** (`notrackpads`)
  - You can also email me at `lamhung00721@gmail.com`, though be warned: I don't check my email(s) often.
<!--
**UnderSet/underset** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
