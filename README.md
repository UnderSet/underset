### Well, hi there!
I'm just someone that sometimes decides to code for fun.

You can reach me through the following:
  - GitLab as `UnderSet` (same as this account)
  - Discord as ***NoTrackpads*** (`notrackpads`)
  - You can also email me at `lamhung00721@gmail.com`, though be warned: I don't check my email(s) often.

*Note: I don't actually use this GitHub account, or as much as I used to. You **will** have slow responses from this account.*
<!--
**UnderSet/underset** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
